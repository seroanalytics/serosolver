# Updates to the _serosolver_ naming convention compared to the published version
In an attempt to standardise terminology used across serodynamics software packages, I have overhauled the naming convention of data objects and variables in serosolver. The intention is to align with the general framework and terminology used in the [_serosim_](https://seroanalytics.org/serosim/) R package and accompanying [paper](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011384).

# Serological data object: _antibody_data_
```{r echo=FALSE, results="antibody_data"}
