\arguments{
\item{par_tab}{The parameter table controlling information such as bounds, initial values etc. See \code{\link{example_par_tab}}}

\item{antibody_data}{The data frame of titre data to be fitted. Must have columns: group (index of group); individual (integer ID of individual); samples (numeric time of sample taken); virus (numeric time of when the virus was circulating); titre (integer of titre value against the given virus at that sampling time); run (integer giving the repeated number of this titre); DOB (integer giving date of birth matching time units used in model). See \code{\link{example_antibody_data}}}

\item{antigenic_map}{(optional) A data frame of antigenic x and y coordinates. Must have column names: x_coord; y_coord; inf_times. See \code{\link{example_antigenic_map}}}

\item{possible_exposure_times}{(optional) If no antigenic map is specified, this argument gives the vector of times at which individuals can be infected}

\item{mcmc_pars}{Named vector named vector with parameters for the MCMC procedure. See details}

\item{mvr_pars}{Leave NULL to use univariate proposals. Otherwise, a list of parameters if using a multivariate proposal. Must contain an initial covariance matrix, weighting for adapting cov matrix, and an initial scaling parameter (0-1)}

\item{start_inf_hist}{Infection history matrix to start MCMC at. Can be left NULL. See \code{\link{example_inf_hist}}}

\item{filename}{The full filepath at which the MCMC chain should be saved. "_chain.csv" will be appended to the end of this, so filename should have no file extensions}

\item{CREATE_POSTERIOR_FUNC}{Pointer to posterior function used to calculate a likelihood. This will probably be \code{\link{create_posterior_func}}}

\item{CREATE_PRIOR_FUNC}{User function of prior for model parameters. Should take parameter values only}

\item{prior_version}{which infection history assumption prior_version to use? See \code{\link{describe_priors}} for options. Can be 1, 2, 3 or 4}

\item{measurement_indices}{optional NULL. For measurement bias function. Vector of indices of length equal to number of circulation times. For each year, gives the index of parameters named "rho" that correspond to each time period}

\item{measurement_random_effects}{optional FALSE. Boolean indicating if measurement bias is a random effects term. If TRUE adds a component to the posterior calculation that calculates the probability of a set of measurement shifts "rho", given a mean and standard deviation}

\item{proposal_ratios}{optional NULL. Can set the relative sampling weights of the infection state times. Should be an integer vector of length matching nrow(antigenic_map). Otherwise, leave as NULL for uniform sampling.}

\item{OPT_TUNING}{Constant describing the amount of leeway when adapting the proposals steps to reach a desired acceptance rate (ie. does not change step size if within OPT_TUNING of the specified acceptance rate)}

\item{temp}{Temperature term for parallel tempering, raises likelihood to this value. Just used for testing at this point}

\item{solve_likelihood}{if FALSE, returns only the prior and does not solve the likelihood. Use this if you wish to sample directly from the prior}

\item{n_alive}{if not NULL, uses this as the number alive for the infection history prior, rather than calculating the number alive based on antibody_data}

\item{...}{Other arguments to pass to CREATE_POSTERIOR_FUNC}
}
\value{
A list with: 1) relative file path at which the MCMC chain is saved as a .csv file; 2) relative file path at which the infection history chain is saved as a .csv file; 3) the last used covariance matrix if mvr_pars != NULL; 4) the last used scale/step size (if multivariate proposals) or vector of step sizes (if univariate proposals)
}
\description{
The Adaptive Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm. Given a starting point and the necessary MCMC parameters as set out below, performs a random-walk of the posterior space to produce an MCMC chain that can be used to generate MCMC density and iteration plots. The algorithm undergoes an adaptive period, where it changes the step size of the random walk for each parameter to approach the desired acceptance rate, popt. The algorithm then uses \code{\link{univ_proposal}} or \code{\link{mvr_proposal}} to explore parameter space, recording the value and posterior value at each step. The MCMC chain is saved in blocks as a .csv file at the location given by filename. This version of the algorithm is also designed to explore posterior densities for infection histories. See the package vignettes for examples.
}
\details{
The \code{mcmc_pars} argument has the following options:
\itemize{
\item iterations (number of post adaptive period iterations to run)
\item adaptive_period (for this many iterations, change proposal step size adaptively every \code{opt_freq} iterations)
\item opt_freq (adapt proposal step size every opt_freq iterations)
\item thin (save every n iterations)
\item thin_hist (infection history thinning)
\item hist_sample_prob (proportion of individuals resampled at each iteration)
\item save_block (after this many iterations (post thinning), save to disk)
\item popt (desired acceptance rate for parameters)
\item popt_hist (desired acceptance rate for infection histories)
\item switch_sample (ratio of infection history samples to theta samples ie. switch_sample = 2 means sample inf hist twice for every theta sample, switch_sample = 0.5 means sample theta twice for every inf hist sample)
\item inf_propn (proportion of infection times to resample for each individual at each iteration)
\item move_size (number of infection years/months to move when performing infection history swap step)
\item hist_opt (if 1, performs adaptive infection history proposals. If 0, retains the starting infection history proposal parameters. This should ONLY be turned on for prior version 2)
\item swap_propn (if using gibbs sampling of infection histories, what proportion of proposals should be swap steps)
\item hist_switch_prob (proportion of infection history proposal steps to swap year_swap_propn of two time periods' contents)
\item year_swap_propn (when swapping contents of two time points, what proportion of individuals should have their contents swapped)
